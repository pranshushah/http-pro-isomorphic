# http-pro-isomorphic
- [http-pro](https://www.npmjs.com/package/http-pro) but for node and browser.

## Usage: 

- SSR support.
- isomorphic code across all environment.
- built on top of [node-fetch](https://www.npmjs.com/package/node-fetch), so it is tried and tested for node environment.

## Requirements :

- Node  `v>=16`
- Browser - checkout [MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Fetch_API#browser_compatibility) docs.

## Installation:
```sh
npm install http-pro @http-pro/isomorphic 
```

## Note:
- If you are working with **node v18** you don't need to use this library. you can just use [http-pro](https://www.npmjs.com/package/http-pro) instead.
- before raising an issue make sure that issue is not related to [node-fetch](https://www.npmjs.com/package/node-fetch).
